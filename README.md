code.

### Write a functional telegram bot.

Talking about the functionality of the bot, the bot 
will have to include the following features:
+ Be able to respond to a message with the same message.
+ Be able to remember time. And give you the opportunity to
write your own message. This message will be sent to the 
user at a time that he himself specifies.
+ The bot will also need to be able to save sent links to 
its numbered list, and it will also need to be able to 
remove messages from this list at the user's discretion.

---

### When writing a project, use the principles of clean architecture and clean code.

It means:
+ This means that me need to follow clean architecture principles when writing applications in the Golang programming language.
+ I will also need to write clean and understandable code.
+ I will also need to introduce documentation so that the project is clear to everyone.
